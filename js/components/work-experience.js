        I led enterprise-scale digital procurement initiatives, optimizing ETL pipelines,
        enhancing data architecture, and integrating SAP S/4 HANA with Coupa to improve
        procurement scalability and data accuracy. My work involved SQL query optimization,
        reducing execution latency, and implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated data ingestion
        using Azure Data Factory and Databricks. Additionally, I contributed to
        workflow automation, leveraging SCRUM methodologies to streamline vendor management
        and approval processes. Through data-driven forecasting and cloud-based infrastructure
        enhancements, I enabled efficient system integrations, reducing procurement redundancy and
        improving operational efficiency across global teams. Additionally,
        I implemented ETL pipelines to integrate data into <a href="https://www.collibra.com/" target="_blank">Collibra</a>,
        making data governance more robust and accessible for teams across the organization.
