            Hi, I'm a graduate student pursuing an MS in Business Analytics at the
            <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin</a>.
            I'm deeply passionate about harnessing the power of data analytics and machine learning to drive strategic decisions
            and solve real-world business challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from
            <a href="https://vit.ac.in/" target="_blank">Vellore Institute of Technology</a>, where I developed a solid
            technical foundation in software engineering, big data analytics, and machine learning. Beyond the classroom,
            I've always been curious—exploring open-source implementations of machine learning systems and solving
            technical challenges independently has been one of my favorite ways to grow.

          <h1 class="section-heading">Kimberly-Clark - Solution Data Engineer and Business Analyst</h1>
          <p>
            As a Solution Data Engineer and Business Analyst at  
            <a href="https://www.kimberly-clark.com/" target="_blank">Kimberly-Clark</a>,  
            I led enterprise-scale digital procurement initiatives, optimizing ETL pipelines, enhancing data architecture, and integrating SAP S/4 HANA with Coupa to improve  
            procurement scalability and data accuracy. My work involved SQL query optimization,  
            reducing execution latency, and implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated data ingestion  
            using Azure Data Factory and Databricks. Additionally, I contributed to  
            workflow automation, leveraging SCRUM methodologies to streamline vendor management  
            and approval processes. Through data-driven forecasting and cloud-based infrastructure  
            enhancements, I enabled efficient system integrations, reducing procurement redundancy and  
            improving operational efficiency across global teams. Additionally,
            I implemented ETL pipelines to integrate data into <a href="https://www.collibra.com/" target="_blank">Collibra</a>,
            making data governance more robust and accessible for teams across the organization.

          <h1 class="section-heading">Architecting an Intelligent Procurement Assistant</h1>
          <p>
            At Kimberly-Clark, a significant part of my journey involved architecting and engineering an enterprise AI agent to automate and enhance procurement operations. I led the development of a <strong>GenAI-powered chatbot</strong>, supervising its creation from end to end. This process began with a deep dive into user needs, where I conducted detailed requirement analyses to ensure the final solution would be truly data-driven and effective.
            The core of this initiative was building a technical solution that integrated <strong>Azure OpenAI</strong> and its powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with our existing systems. I designed a sophisticated three-layer API gateway architecture to serve as the chatbot's foundation, creating a robust and scalable system to handle a massive volume of interactions. The chatbot was engineered to serve as an intelligent assistant, automating query resolution and streamlining workflows through an intelligent routing system that was continuously fine-tuned to optimize its performance.
            To support global teams, I implemented multilingual NLP capabilities using Azure Cognitive Services, which allowed for dynamic entity extraction and translation. Furthermore, I designed unsupervised clustering pipelines to group supplier queries and automate category tagging, which improved routing accuracy and response consistency in ServiceNow. The project culminated in demonstrating the chatbot's value to executive audiences through a compelling proof-of-concept, showcasing its ability to transform procurement efficiency.

        <h1 class="section-heading">A Glimpse into My Capstone Journey</h1>
          <p>
            As a Technical Lead (Data Science Lead) for my capstone project with <strong>NetApp</strong>, I had the opportunity to dive deep into a real-world business challenge. Our mission was to uncover the hidden stories within vast streams of customer data. We moved beyond just looking at numbers; we sought to understand the 'why' behind user actions. By applying statistical models and machine learning, we identified distinct patterns in how users engaged with the platform. This exploration led to the creation of strategic recommendations and segmentation models, offering a new lens through which the business could view its market and drive growth. It was a rewarding experience in translating raw data into a compelling narrative for strategic change.

        My journey in analytics and technology has been hands-on and rewarding. I've built expertise in Python, SQL,
        and machine learning while honing my data visualization skills using tools like Tableau and Power BI.
        Through internships and projects, I've learned to take ideas from concept to implementation,
        developing predictive models and advanced analytics that create actionable insights.

        I'm always eager to learn and collaborate. If you're interested in connecting, feel free to reach out—I'm excited
        to explore opportunities where I can combine my technical expertise, procurement experience, and business acumen
        to make an impact.
