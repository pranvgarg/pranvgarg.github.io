            Hi, I'm a graduate student pursuing an MS in Business Analytics at the
            <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin</a>.
            I'm deeply passionate about harnessing the power of data analytics and machine learning to drive strategic decisions
            and solve real-world business challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from
            <a href="https://vit.ac.in/" target="_blank">Vellore Institute of Technology</a>, where I developed a solid
            technical foundation in software engineering, big data analytics, and machine learning. Beyond the classroom,
            I've always been curious—exploring open-source implementations of machine learning systems and solving
            technical challenges independently has been one of my favorite ways to grow.

      <h2 class="section-heading">Work Experience</h2>
      <p>
        As a Solution Data Engineer and Business Analyst at  
        <a href="https://www.kimberly-clark.com/" target="_blank">Kimberly-Clark</a>,  
        I led enterprise-scale digital procurement initiatives, optimizing ETL pipelines,  
        enhancing data architecture, and integrating SAP S/4 HANA with Coupa to improve  
        procurement scalability and data accuracy. My work involved SQL query optimization,  
        reducing execution latency, and implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated data ingestion  
        using Azure Data Factory and Databricks. Additionally, I contributed to  
        workflow automation, leveraging SCRUM methodologies to streamline vendor management  
        and approval processes. Through data-driven forecasting and cloud-based infrastructure  
        enhancements, I enabled efficient system integrations, reducing procurement redundancy and  
        improving operational efficiency across global teams. Additionally,
        I implemented ETL pipelines to integrate data into <a href="https://www.collibra.com/" target="_blank">Collibra</a>,
        making data governance more robust and accessible for teams across the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in analytics and technology has been hands-on and rewarding. I've built expertise in Python, SQL,
        and machine learning while honing my data visualization skills using tools like Tableau and Power BI.
        Through internships and projects, I've learned to take ideas from concept to implementation,
        developing predictive models and advanced analytics that create actionable insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always eager to learn and collaborate. If you're interested in connecting, feel free to reach out—I'm excited
        to explore opportunities where I can combine my technical expertise, procurement experience, and business acumen
        to make an impact.

            </h3>
            <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> 
              This project provided hands-on experience in implementing <span class="highlight">Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)</span> for game decision-making, training a <span class="highlight">CNN-based AI</span> for spatial pattern recognition, and leveraging <span class="highlight">Transformer-based AI</span> for sequence-based strategic play. I gained insights into deep learning architectures, Docker containerization, and AWS Lightsail deployment.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>CNN vs. Transformer Performance: CNNs excel at spatial recognition and short-term tactics, achieving 76% accuracy, whereas Transformers focus on long-term play but struggle with localized dependencies (67% accuracy).</li>
              <li>Efficient Data Generation: Self-play with MCTS generated 1.8M+ labeled game states, speeding up AI training.</li>
              <li>Docker & Anvil Uplink for Deployment: Containerized AI models using Docker & Docker Compose and deployed on AWS Lightsail, ensuring scalability and efficient cloud execution.</li>
              <li>Game Optimization: Integrated TensorFlow optimizations and environment variable tuning to minimize GPU memory overloads and reduce model inference time.</li>

              </a>
            </h3>
            <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> I gained practical experience in building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch for multi-class image classification. This project strengthened my understanding of CNN architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> The model achieved strong performance (93.57% training accuracy and 85.72% validation accuracy) but faced challenges in distinguishing visually similar categories. Pooling layers proved effective for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers were critical for classification.</p>
            <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Refining the model by separately training visually similar classes and exploring advanced architectures could further enhance accuracy while maintaining generalization.</p>

                Predicting ICU Mortality Using Machine Learning: A Global Perspective
              </a>
            </h3>
            <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> 
              This project gave me valuable experience in developing machine learning models for healthcare applications. I deepened my understanding of how to handle imbalanced datasets using techniques like SMOTENC, how to evaluate models with various metrics (e.g., accuracy, recall, ROC AUC), and how to apply dimensionality reduction (PCA) to streamline high-dimensional data. It also reinforced the importance of global data and model generalization across diverse healthcare systems.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> 
              The project demonstrated the power of ensemble methods (like Random Forest and XGBoost) and neural networks in improving model performance. It was interesting to observe how the MLP model outperformed traditional methods like APACHE in terms of recall, which is crucial for minimizing false negatives in critical healthcare predictions.
